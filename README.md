# -Performance-Comparison-Executing-My-First-Lab-Program-in-Python-vs.-C-
This project presents an engineering term dictionary in Python and C++. Python uses a dictionary named Terminology for quick lookups, while C++ uses if-else statements. Python is more efficient, while C++ highlights conditional logic. Both versions handle invalid inputs, offering a clear comparison of their implementations.
